Experiment to use guitar playing skills to write code -- stay tuned (npi) :)

It is by far anywhere near I'd want it, but it's a start ;) 

You can play with it [here](http://thlorenz.github.io/guitypist/).

## Future features

- definitely improve pitch recognition and speed it up
- distinguish long/short notes
- use licks for snippets
- use licks for multi key short cuts i.e. `Ctrl-j`
- enable `Shift` key
